# Silence-broken-by-metal-pipe-falling-sfx
A dumb python program that startles you with a falling pipe sfx

It will wait in the background tasks for a random amount of time between 1 and 20 minutes, after that, a loud metal pipe sfx will play and the process repeats
The only way to kill it is to do it manually via task manager or cmd (The default is pipe.exe)

Do what you want with it, but I do not take any responsability for anything


=========================================================================

NEW VERSION: PIPE 2.0
This new version is larger (reason why is not available compiled) and does more. Apart from the annoying sound, a pipe image is brought up, disturbing your work even more!
Also, just for the fun of it, it locks your computer and shows you a monke when you unlock it again, for extra funny. And, because I enjoy a little trolling just like that, it
also copies itself to the startup folder so you can enjoy pipe without having to execute it again!

WARNING: Due to the behaviour of this program (mainly the part where it copies itself to run on startup) some antivirus like kaspersky detect it as a trojan and fairly so as this
does have some malware-like behaviour. If you want to try it, I reccomend adding an exception to the antivirus (Be careful as exceptions are just literal holes you leave in your defense)
but DO NOT disable the antivirus, any program that asks for that has malicious intent. Much like pipe v1, it also gets detected by VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload)

IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE IT COMPLETELY, FIRST STOP IN IN TASK MANAGER (LOOK FOR PIPE 2.0 OR WHATEVER NAME YOU GIVE IT WHEN YOU COMPILE IT) AND THEN PRESS WIN + R, TYPE "shell:startup" AND
PRESS ENTER, THIS WILL BRING THE STARTUP FOLDER WHERE YOU CAN REMOVE THE COPY OF THE FILE SO IT DOES NOT LAUNCH ON IT'S OWN AGAIN.

DISCLAIMER:
The program is completely safe, it does not spread, it doesn't steal data or do anything nefarious and should not cause any damage to your machine. That said however, I take no responsability 
for any missuse of this program, you are the sole responsible person if you somehow manage to screw it up and/or if you use this as a base to something more nefarious.

C'mon guys, im up for a little trolling as much as the next guy but for the love of god don't put this in your grandpa's or teacher's pc, be a little more mature.
