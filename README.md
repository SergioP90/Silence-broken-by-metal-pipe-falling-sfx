# Silence-broken-by-metal-pipe-falling-sfx
A dumb python program that startles you with a falling pipe sfx

It will wait in the background tasks for a random amount of time between 1 and 20 minutes, after that, a loud metal pipe sfx will play and the process repeats
The only way to kill it is to do it manually via task manager or cmd (The default is pipe.exe)

Do what you want with it, but I do not take any responsability for anything
